# Housing Price Predictor

This repository contains a machine-learning model that predicts housing prices based on multiple house features.
## Project Description
This project involved the development of a machine learning model using multiple linear regression to predict housing prices. It demonstrates my ability to handle a clean dataset and implement an Ordinary Least Squares regression model to make accurate predictions. The model was implemented in Google Colaboratory.
## Repository Contents
Housing Price Predictor.ipynb: This notebook contains all the Python code I used to implement the multiple linear regression model.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features of houses. It was already cleaned and well-structured, which made it possible for me to carry out a direct model implementation without the need for additional preprocessing or exploratory data analysis
## Methodology
This project was completed using the Python programming language in google colab. The primary library used for the model was the statsmodels library, which was used to implement the Ordinary Least Squares regression model.
## Results
The multiple linear regression model successfully predicted house prices based on the given features. The model follows the equation:
salePrice= b0 + b1(lotArea)+b2(quality) + b3(condition)+ b4(BsmtSF)+b5(floorOneSF)+b6(floorTwoSF) + b7(bsmtFullBath)+b8(noRooms) + b9(firePlaces) +b10(garageCars) + b11(woodDeckSF)
## Future Work
This project serves as a basic demonstration of a multiple linear regression model. Future iterations could include more advanced techniques or models to improve on the prediction accuracy of the model.
