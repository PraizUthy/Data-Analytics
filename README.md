# Data-Analytics

I developed a machine learning model, the "Housing Price Predictor", which used multiple linear regression to forecast housing prices based on a variety of house features in the dataset. 
Leveraging Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Sklearn, I built a model that demonstrated a high level of accuracy in its predictions.
This project not only showcased my technical abilities in data science but also provided a practical tool that could assist both homebuyers and sellers in the real estate market.
The code was written using the google colab.
